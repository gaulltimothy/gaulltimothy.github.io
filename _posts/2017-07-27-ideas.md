Hey! Welcome to my site, it's great to have you :)

Knowing how important first impressions are, I wrote this quick introdution to help you get to know me a little better.

### I have a few principle systems that I like to work with

1. **Atomic Design Systems**. If you haven't checked out [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), you really should! Implemented properly, it is a foundational tool to unleashing your product and development teams to create at their highest capabilities.
2. **Lean Methodology**. I subscribe whole-heartedly to the emerging consensus around the build, measure, learn model. Some of the thinking that has influenced and formed my approach include, [The Sprint Book](https://www.thesprintbook.com/), [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/)
and [Steve Blank's writings](https://steveblank.com/category/business-model-versus-business-plan/).
3. **Having Fun**. Need I say more? :)
