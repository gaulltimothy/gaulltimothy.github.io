<h3 id="biography">BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<p>Armed with more than 100 credit hours across Architecture and Web Design majors, peak recession, Timothy began searching for his purpose through work. His evangelical roots saw him enter adulthood with an on the torward becoming a missionary in Morocco, where he ended up living and contributing to a series of web and interactive projects for local non-profits focused on humantarian causes. When he confronted his gayness, he was asked to resign from that path, leading him back to his hometown in Kansas City. There, he worked to resolve his identity and launch a career in tech. His keen interest in entrepreneurship led him develop that skillst alongside some of the brightest minds at the Kauffman Foundation’s entreprenuership programing.</p>

<p>The experience provided him a series of experiences and growth that enabled him the opportunity to become the Designer in Residence at Lightbank, the Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky’s venture fund. He was the lead designer for ChicagoIdeas.com relaunch. Additionally, he helped incubate the design teams for what became three of Chicago’s star data-centered unicorns, Uptake, Drivin, and Tempus. Inspired by the examples around him, he launched his startup, Explore Mojave, alongside his design consulting business. Explore Mojave proved a viable problem to solve. Still, customer acquisition proved to costly to scale as quickly as the team needed, Timothy decided to pivot his career, focused on New York City. Initially landing a terminal contract role, he outperformed and parlayed that into a tremendous FTE opportunity with a major multinational financial services firm, AllianceBernstein.</p>

<p>Currently, he leads the user-centered design of AB’s retail and institutional distribution channels. He is uses user centered design methods, lean startup, and agile methods to integrate custom applications,Salesforce, a vast array of data, and more to enhance the employee experience and to improve the firm’s distribution capabilities.</p>
